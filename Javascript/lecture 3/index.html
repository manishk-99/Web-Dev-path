<!--  *Javascript defines 7 built-in types\
       .Object and 6 primitives
      *Object type is a collection of name/value pairs
      *Primitive type can contain a single,immutable value
      *Undefined means variable memory has been allocated but no value has ever been explicity set yet  -->
